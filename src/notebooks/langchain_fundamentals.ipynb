      "Summary:\n",
      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit characteristics of agency, meaning they can autonomously perceive environments, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Often designed to simulate decision-making processes similar to those of humans or animals, agentic AI systems have applications across various domains, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual personal assistants, and complex simulations. The development of agentic AI involves interdisciplinary approaches, integrating advancements in machine learning, cognitive science, and robotics. With the potential to perform tasks without direct human intervention, agentic AI raises important ethical and safety considerations, including concerns about accountability, transparency, and the impact on employment and society.\n",

      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems endowed with some level of agency, meaning they can make decisions and take actions autonomously based on their programming and the environment. Here are three key points about Agentic AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Autonomy and Decision-Making**: Agentic AI systems are designed to operate with a certain degree of independence. They can analyze data, make decisions, and perform actions without needing direct human intervention for each step. This capability allows them to adapt to changes in their environment and execute tasks more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ethical and Safety Considerations**: The autonomous nature of Agentic AI raises important ethical and safety concerns. It is crucial to ensure that these systems align with human values and societal norms, and that they are safe to interact with real-world environments. Developers must address issues such as accountability, transparency, and bias to prevent undesirable outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Applications Across Various Domains**: Agentic AI can be applied in numerous fields, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, smart assistants, and industrial automation. In each of these areas, Agentic AI has the potential to enhance productivity, improve efficiency, and enable new capabilities that were not feasible with traditional automation methods.\n"
